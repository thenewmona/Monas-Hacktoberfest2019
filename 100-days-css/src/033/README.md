Time taken: ~15mins

Things I learnt:

* Import is pug's way of componentizing things. I've found a beautiful little
repo of a beautiful little webpage that doesn't use any framework. Doesn't
use jQuery or lodash either. It uses pug, parcel, mustache, typescript,
postcss... and that's about it. Pug's `include` provides natural HTML 
'components'. Parcel puts this all together. It's beautiful, really, and
makes me want to experiment *not* using a single web framework. Write my own
packaging scripts. Build everything from the bottom up.
