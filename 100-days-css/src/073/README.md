Time taken: ~15min

Things I learnt:

This one's another easy challenge that I could do in the 30 minutes before I go to bed.

I learnt that... by having the exact same state on 0% and 100% you could write seemingly 
continuous initinite animations. The illusion of an infinite rolling text. It's actually 
easier than I thought.

First challenge completed where I didn't use any of the source code. Not for font size or
text shadow, not for animation keyframes or times - it's the first time I replicated this 
(perfectly, if I might say) all on my own.

I'm getting better (or at least more confident) at this.
